# ML_Project
## What?
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.
## Why?
- For fun
- To learn
## How?
Neural Image Style Transfer Project was implemented using Pytorch framework. I used a pre-trained VGG-19 convolutional neural network as a feature extractor for content image and style image and later backpropagated it to minimize the loss function (comprising of content loss as well as style loss functions) to get the required target image.
## Tools and Libraries
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pythorch framework
- General ML Libraries
## Future Work
- To deploy the project using cloud services to get better result.
